# Mine-Locations
A website dedicated to helping minecraft players. In it, they will be able to write the places of their world and their names, saving them, deleting them and so on. Made in React and using Node.js RESTful API's 

->Javascript dependencies:

  Backend
  
    express: provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers.
    
    cors: middleware that can be used to enable CORS.
    
    mysql2: provide mysql driver.

    sequelize: an ORM used for DB interaction.
    
  Frontend
  
    react: library for creating user interfaces.
    
    react-dom: react library who assist "react" and work with the dom.

->Little talk about how to setup the project to run:

    Install Node.js and use CMD in the project directory to interact with npm

    Go to "server side" and "client side", print "npm install" on both

    In the "server-side" directory, print "npm start" to run the back-end server

    In the "client-side" directory, print "npm run dev" to run the front-end server

    Choose a browser and enter the URL "http://localhost:5173/"

    Have a good time!

->Obs:

    This site is not finished. That's because the time to implement everything would be huge, so I chose to leave it that way, after all it was just a project to study and improve my skills.

    I skipped the database info(like tables and etc) needed to config the project in the comment above, don't forget that part!
